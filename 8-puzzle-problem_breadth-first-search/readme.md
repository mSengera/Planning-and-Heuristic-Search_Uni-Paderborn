# Solving the 8-puzzles problem
Solving the 8-puzzles problem with breadth first search, an graph algorithm.

## The 8-puzzles problem
"The 8-puzzle is a smaller version of the slightly better known 15-puzzle. The puzzle consists of an area divided into a
grid, 3 by 3 for the 8-puzzle, 4 by 4 for the 15-puzzle. On each grid square is a tile, expect for one square which remains
empty. Thus, there are eight tiles in the 8-puzzle and 15 tiles in the 15-puzzle. A tile that is next to the empty grid square
can be moved into the empty space, leaving its previous position empty in turn. Tiles are numbered, 1 thru 8 for the 8-puzzle,
so that each tile can be uniquely identified.
The aim of the puzzle is to achieve a given configuration of tiles from a given (different) configuration by sliding the
individual tiles around the grid as described above."

## Solving the problem with grapgh algorithm
I solved the problem with an graph algorithm, the breadth first search. The algorithm is programmed in python.

## Inputs
Inputs for the BFS() function

- A starting Node 's' as an instance of 'Node"

- A target board configuration as an array. \
target_board_configuration = \
        [ \
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[1, 2, 3], \
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[8, 0, 4], \
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[7, 6, 5] \
]

- An integer as "depth-bound". (Maximum depth to search)

### Usage
BFS(s, target_board_configuration, depth_bound)
